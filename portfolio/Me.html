        <p>My name is Cristian Delgado. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science degree, Software Development at BYU Idaho. I have one subject left to obtain the Web & Computer Programming certificate.
            From a very young age, I had the desire to learn to program, but due to my family's economic situation, I was not able to pay for my studies until now thanks to the opportunity to study at an affordable price at this great University.
            I have certificates in Program Testing and a degree in Administration.
            I am an ethical, responsible, honest, and committed person. I have the
            ability to negotiate and take the initiative to solve problems
            efficient manner. I am analytical in decision-making.
            During the 13 years of development in different companies I had the opportunity to manage different ERP systems, I also developed skills in managing programs such as Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and managing Web pages of different companies.
            This knowledge added to what I acquired recently in the fields of program development through different programming languages such as Python, C#, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and My SQL, and the experience in managing the Spiraplan system gave me tools to start in my career development path in the IT field.
            I fervently believe that I will be able to start collaborating with the company as a Junior Tester. I continue to develop skills through the knowledge I receive at the University so that in the near future I can contribute greater value to the team by working in more important positions as a developer, for example.
            I am also willing to develop the skills and obtain the knowledge necessary to assist in achieving the company's objectives.</p>
